    <!-- When clicking this button, it sends the value of the input element and the param name is the value
    we give to the name param in the input element (in this case the param's name is "name", but if we change the value
    of the param name in the input element to, for example, banana, in authors.js we will have access to req.body.banana instead
    of req.body.name). The param "name" comes from the input element in the file _form_fields -->
